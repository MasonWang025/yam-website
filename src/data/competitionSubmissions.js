    description: "I believe that vulnerability is key to becoming at peace with yourself. When you expose and acknowledge your most vulnerable parts of yourself, you experience a form of self growth like no other. Since willow trees symbolize a sense of belonging and safety, I drew a willow tree growing out of a person's head. In drawing the person exposing their back as well as including the exposed tree roots and heart-shaped trunk, I wanted to convey a feeling of fragility or defenselessness.",

    description: "Autism in women isn’t talked about as much as autism in men, which is why for so long I did not understand my autism. This year has been a period of personal discovery about my autistic identity. This portrait isn’t as much about me as it is about conveying the beauty of autism in women. This painting depicts my autistic identity and the discovery of how beautiful neurodiversity is. The colorful abstract elements in the background symbolize the amazing things that can come out from being autistic. I used a multitude of colors to express the colorfulness and diversity of neuro-diverse individuals.  I mixed abstract and realism styles in my work to show that autistic people have access to “autistic superpowers” that are unique to them. Neurodiversity and disability rights is something I am passionate about.",

    description: "In my gouache piece, I painted one of my all-time favorite birds: the cardinal. Though I don't exactly recall when my admiration for them started, there is a memory involving a cardinal which I vividly remember from when I used to live in Texas. I spent most of my childhood in Texas, and thinking of it now, those days were much more relaxing and calming compared to my busy life now. One afternoon, after school was let out, I ran out to meet up with my mom and noticed the brightest red bird perching on a bare branch. The fusions of its saturated red contrasted with the emerald green tree has stuck with me; even when I moved to California. My blissful and innocent childhood has almost been erased from my memory, especially since my present life is filled with school, homework, and extracurricular activities. Now, I tend to associate the beautiful cardinal bird with my younger childhood, and days when I didn't feel as burdened with work.",
