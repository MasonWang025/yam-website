                    We are dedicated to magnifying the voices of the unheard. Too often did we see the same story;
                    young artists and writers taking a begrudged back seat. From school funding to basic recognition,
                    we realized a fundamental appreciation for art was missing from schools near and far from our founding
                    place of Saratoga, CA.

                  <p className="lead-p">
                    We founded the Youth Arts Movement as a response to such imbalance, seeking to showcase student
                    artwork and provide opportunities to the young artists who needed it most. YAM strives to close this
                    gap between the STEM field and the arts, emphasizing the importance of both in our society today.
